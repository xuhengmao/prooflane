/**
 * Align a fresh parse's assistant turns onto this session's completed local
 * assistant turns and emit the metadata (usage / duration / model /
 * completed_at) to backfill onto each.
 *
 * The subtlety is history. `localTurns` holds ONLY turns completed in the
 * current session; persisted history lives in `detail`. The fresh parse
 * returns history + this session's turns in order, so the local turns line up
 * with the parse TAIL, past the `persistedAssistantCount` historical turns —
 * hence the slice below before any offset math.
 *
 * That boundary is also what makes the "fold extra parser sub-turns into
 * local[0]" step correct. When the parser splits the current reply into MORE
 * sub-turns than the live stream did, the leading unmatched SESSION turns are
 * genuine sub-turns of local[0] and their stats must be summed in (so the
 * post-stream total matches a fresh reload). Folding the FULL parse instead —
 * the original bug — summed every historical turn's duration/usage into the
 * first reply after resuming a conversation; because {@link
 * conversationRuntimeReducer}'s PATCH_TURN_METADATA is first-write-wins, that
 * wrong value then stuck until a full reload cleared localTurns and rendered
 * each parsed turn directly.
 *
 * A parse that hasn't caught up yet (fewer session turns than local) head-
 * aligns the turns it does have and leaves the rest unpatched, so a later
 * local reply never inherits an earlier one's stats and the caller's retry can
 * pick up the complete parse rather than lock in a stale value.
 *
 * `persistedAssistantCount` is the caller's send-time history baseline (see the
 * session's `historyAssistantBaseline`), so it is immune to a mid-stream detail
 * refetch folding this session's own partial into `detail`. `0` treats the
 * whole parse as this session's — correct when `localTurns` overlaps the parse
 * tail (the sub-agent adopt path) and identical to the pre-slice behavior.

// open conversation's detail. So the viewer keeps rendering its stale detail
// (the prompt, no reply). The fix polls the persisted transcript on that nudge.
//
// The catch (verified against the backend): every turn-end signal
// (`conversation://changed` Status, `turn_complete`) fires off the ACP wire
// stop-reason, which RACES the agent CLI flushing its transcript JSONL. Detail
// is a live parse of whatever bytes are on disk, so a single refetch can still
// return the pre-reply transcript. We therefore poll a bounded number of times,
// backing off, and stop as soon as the transcript's last turn is no longer a

 * Rendering both duplicates the whole assistant turn (visible doubling +
 * React duplicate-key warnings once `mergeConsecutiveAssistantTurns`
 * flat-maps their parts).
 *
 * Retain rule is role-aware (all entries sharing an id are the same
 * underlying turn, so the role is unambiguous):
 *   - ASSISTANT (and any non-user): keep the LAST occurrence. The live
 *     streaming copy (appended last) wins over an earlier promoted
 *     snapshot, and a re-promoted local turn wins over its stale copy.
 *   - USER: keep the FIRST occurrence. When the detail endpoint stamps the

 *     assistant reply; a same-id optimistic/synthesized copy is appended

 *     refetch). Keeping the persisted copy preserves ordering — otherwise
 *     the prompt would render after its own streaming reply.
 * Real turns always have distinct ids (liveMessage.id is minted fresh per
 * prompt cycle, DB turn ids are unique), so a normal multi-turn timeline
 * has no collisions and is returned untouched.
 *
 * The key includes the role, not just the id, so the merge only ever
 * collapses entries that are genuinely the same turn (same id AND role).
 * Should two DIFFERENT-role turns ever share an id — only reachable via a
 * client id that collided into another namespace — they are kept separately
 * (a recoverable visible duplicate) instead of one silently overwriting the
 * other, which could hide a user prompt.
