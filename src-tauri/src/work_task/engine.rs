//! Work-task execution engine: drives the manual pipeline
//! `todo → queued → running ⇄ awaiting_input → review → merging → done`.
//!
//! Structure mirrors `automation::engine` (single per-process engine elected by
//! an exclusive data-dir file lock; a `tokio::select!` loop over the internal
//! event bus + a reconcile tick), with three task-specific additions:
//! - **run_seq generations**: every launch claims a new `run_seq`; events are
//!   matched on `(connection_id, run_seq)` and settle through CAS updates, so a
//!   cancel racing a late `TurnComplete` is a zero-side-effect no-op.
//! - **backend-driven awaiting_input**: the engine subscribes to
//!   Question/Permission/PlanApproval request+resolve events (the frontend has
//!   no global pending-question channel for unopened conversations) and flips
//!   `running ⇄ awaiting_input` from an outstanding-request-id set.
//! - **two-stage merge with persisted intent**: stage A merges base INTO the
//!   worktree (conflicts always land there); stage B lands on the base branch
//!   in the project folder under a per-folder git mutex, with the merge intent
//!   persisted before execution so crash recovery can replay git truth.
