; Tauri NSIS installer hooks.
;
; codeg-mcp.exe is the MCP stdio companion spawned by each agent CLI
; (claude / codex / opencode / ...), which is itself a grandchild of
; Prooflane.exe. Windows does not propagate parent death to descendants the
; way Unix does, so stale codeg-mcp.exe processes from a previous session
; can keep the binary file locked. The installer then fails to overwrite
; it with:
;
;     Error opening file for writing: ...\Prooflane\codeg-mcp.exe
;
; Stop any running companion processes before the installer writes new
; binaries (or removes the existing ones on uninstall). taskkill returns
; non-zero when no processes match, which is fine — we ignore the result.
